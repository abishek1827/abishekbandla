<p2>Eoin Morgan, England's captain, displayed the same calm in the aftermath of victory that he and his team had shown at the height of a pulsating contest in Delhi, as he played down the significance of England's progress to the semi-finals of the World T20 by insisting he was happy simply to see the improvement in their performances from match to match.</p2>
<p>England appeared to have the contest done and dusted when Sri Lanka collapsed to 15 for 4 in the third over, chasing a daunting target of 172 thanks to Jos Buttler's hard-hitting 66 not out from 37 balls. However, Sri Lanka's captain, Angelo Mathews, rallied his side with a superb 73 not out from 54 balls and, with 15 runs needed from the final six balls, it took an exemplary over from Ben Stokes to put England through to the last four.</p>
